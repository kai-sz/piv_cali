# piv_cali

This package performs a simple iterative camera calibration process using one view of the camera, which is typical for planar PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) or PTV (Particle Tracking Velocimetry) measurements.

It requires the Image Processing Toolboxâ„¢ from MATLAB, and was tested on MATLAB R2020b.

The file 'cali_test.m' gives an example of the calibration process, and the dewarping process with sample calibration images of cirular patterns.
